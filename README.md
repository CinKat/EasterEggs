The challenge

The challenge is to build a set of functions based on Javascript using the Factory Pattern. The required functions are the ones described below:

    A Factory Function called EasterEgg will handle how each one of the other functions will be created and which arguments each one of them will need. The easter eggs function can create a clock, marquee, tic tac toe, and formatter.
    A Loader constructor function, this loader will have a load method, this method will be called every time we want to change the current easter egg. On each change, it will show a loading animation that will last 3 seconds with the frames | / - \ and then present us with the selected option.
    A Clock constructor function, the objects generated by this function will show a real-time clock in the console with the format hh:mm:ss. The console should be cleared on each render so we can see the clock as a single line. When we click on any place of the window, the clock should disappear and the message Let's keep playing! should appear in the console.
